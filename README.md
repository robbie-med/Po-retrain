# PO Retraining (Oral Intake Reconditioning)

A practical, physiology-first framework for **retraining oral intake (PO)** after prolonged underuse, illness, dysmotility, neurologic injury, or medically-driven avoidance of eating.

This site is designed as a **one-stop, patient-facing and clinician-usable resource** that explains *what is happening*, *why symptoms occur*, and *how to move forward safely* without prematurely labeling the process as psychiatric.

---

## Purpose

Prolonged reduction or cessation of oral intake leads to predictable, **reversible physiologic changes**, including:

- Reduced gastric accommodation and compliance  
- Heightened visceral sensation (esophagus, stomach, pharynx)  
- Altered oral–sensory tolerance (texture, temperature, volume)  
- Dysregulated feedback between swallowing, peristalsis, and gastric emptying  

When patients attempt to resume eating, these normal consequences are often misinterpreted as **new pathology**, leading to fear-based avoidance and stalled recovery.

This project provides a **structured reconditioning plan** that treats eating like any other deconditioned biologic function.

## Design Philosophy

- **Physiology-forward**: grounded in anatomy, motility, and sensory adaptation  
- **Non-psychiatric framing**: avoids language that undermines patient buy-in  
- **Stepwise and explicit**: clear goals, progression criteria, and expectations  
- **Normalizing**: explains why symptoms occur and why they improve with exposure  
- **Behaviorally informed** (but not labeled): borrows from exposure principles without psychiatric framing

## What This Site Covers

### 1. Oral & Sensory Reconditioning
- Holding food in the mouth
- Texture and temperature exposure
- Re-learning normal oral sensations
- Separating *sensation* from *danger*

### 2. Swallowing & Esophageal Adaptation
- Normal peristalsis sensations
- Transient globus and pressure
- Why “feeling it go down” is common early on

### 3. Gastric Volume Retraining
- Small, frequent volumes
- Expected fullness, pressure, reflux-like sensations
- Day-to-day and week-to-week adaptation timelines

### 4. Posture & Mechanics
- Head/neck position effects
- Gravity, diaphragmatic tension, and reflux perception
- Practical positioning tips during refeeding

### 5. Cognitive Friction Points
- Anticipatory symptoms
- Symptom checking and hypervigilance
- How reassurance can *fail* if physiology is not explained

## What This Site Is *Not*

- Not a replacement for medical evaluation  
- Not a dismissal of symptoms  
- Not a psychiatric diagnosis or therapy site  
- Not a substitute for dietitian, SLP, or GI care when indicated  

This resource assumes **serious pathology has been reasonably excluded** and focuses on *recovery after underuse*.

---

## Intended Audience

- Patients recovering from prolonged low-PO states  
- Clinicians counseling patients with dysmotility-adjacent complaints  
- Caregivers supporting refeeding  
- Trainees looking for language that improves patient buy-in  

---

## How to Use

- Patients: read sequentially, do not skip steps, expect discomfort that improves  
- Clinicians: share sections selectively, reinforce the physiologic model  
- Educators: adapt language for handouts or bedside counseling
